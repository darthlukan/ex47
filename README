# ex47 game skeleton

This game outlines the template for programs written in python 
as laid out in Zed A. Shaw in his book "Learn Python The Hard Way".

It is meant as nothing more than a learning device to get into 
good coding practices and to further develop my own personal skills.
I am loading this game to github to get used to maintaining software
and to also help anyone else who may be thinking of using python for 
their programming needs.  

With that said, thanks for actually reading this file and it is my sincerest hope
that this little example program will help you to learn just as it has helped me.

All credit to Zed A. Shaw for his wonderful books and through them, his ability
to channel the insight needed to develop basic programming skills.
